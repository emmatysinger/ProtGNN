The term refers to two different syndromes, each representing a different stage of the disease. Wernicke's encephalopathy represents the 'acute' phase and Korsakoff's syndrome represents the 'chronic' phase. However, they are used interchangeable in many sites. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by confusion, abnormal stance and gait (ataxia), and abnormal eye movements (nystagmus). Korsakoff's syndrome is observed in a small number of patients. It is a type of dementia, characterized by memory loss and confabulation (filling in of memory gaps with data the patient can readily recall) and involvement of the heart, vascular, and nervous system. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome mainly results from chronic alcohol use, but also from dietary deficiencies, prolonged vomiting, eating disorders, systemic diseases (cancer, AIDS, infections), bariatric surgery, transplants, or the effects of chemotherapy. Studies indicate that there may be some genetic predisposition for the disease.Treatment involves supplementing the diet with thiamine.

XLAG differs considerably from classical lissencephaly, as the resulting cortical thickness is only 6-7 mm in XLAG, rather than 15-20 mm seen in classical lissencephaly due to mutations of the PAFAH1B1 or DCX genes. In 2002, mutations in the X-linked aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX ; Xp21.3) were identified in individuals with XLAG and in some of their female relatives. Mouse Arx and human ARX are highly expressed in both dorsal and ventral telencephalon, including the neocortical ventricular zone and germinal zone of the ganglionic eminence, with less intense signals in the subventricular zone, cortical plate, hippocampus, basal ganglia and ventral thalamus. Arx-deficient mice showed deficient tangential migration and abnormal differentiation of GABAergic interneurons in the ganglionic eminence and neocortex, as well as abnormal testicular differentiation. These characteristics include some of the clinical features of XLAG in humans. The ARX mutations in XLAG patients were predominantly premature termination mutations (large deletions, frameshift, nonsense mutations, splice site mutations) while the missense mutations were less common and located essentially in the homeobox domain. Patients carrying nonconservative missense mutations within the homeobox, showed less severe XLAG, while conservative substitution in the homeodomain caused Proud syndrome (ACC with abnormal genitalia). A non conservative missense mutation near the C-terminal aristaless domain caused unusually severe XLAG with microcephaly and mild cerebellar hypoplasia. The ARX mutations are also associated with a spectrum of milder phenotypes, without macroscopic malformations of the brain, such as X-linked infantile spasms, a syndrome featuring mental retardation associated with distal dystonic movements (Partington syndrome), autistic features and nonsyndromicintellectual deficit.",10.181862,0.76670396

It is mainly found in females and is characterized by small or poorly developed eyes (microphthalmia) and characteristic linear skin markings on the head and neck. The signs and symptoms of this condition may include abnormalities of the brain, heart, and genitourinary system. Other symptoms may include short stature, developmental delay, and finger and toenails that do not grow normally (nail dystrophy). MLS syndrome is typically caused by either a deletion of certain genetic material on the p (short) arm of the X chromosome or by a mutation in the HCCS gene. In some cases, it may be caused by mutations in the COX7B and NDUFB11 genes, (also located on the X chromosome). According to the mutated gene, the disease may be classified in three subtypes. This condition is inherited in an X-linked manner and is thought to result in serious early developmental concerns in males, leading to almost no males with this condition surviving to delivery.Although there is no specific treatment or cure for MLS syndrome, there may be ways to manage the symptoms. A team of doctors is often needed to figure out the treatment options based on each person's symptoms.",8.466,1.5461084

10896,"Pigment-dispersion syndrome is an eye disorder that occurs when pigment granules that normally adhere to the back of the iris (the colored part of the eye) flake off into the clear fluid produced by the eye (aqueous humor). These pigment granules may flow towards the drainage canals of the eye, slowly clogging them and raising the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure or IOP). This rise in eye pressure can cause damage to the optic nerve (the nerve in the back of the eye that carries visual images to the brain). If the optic nerve becomes damaged, pigment-dispersion syndrome becomes pigmentary glaucoma. This happens in about 30% of cases. Pigment-dispersion syndrome commonly presents between the second and fourth decades, which is earlier than other types of glaucoma. While men and women are affected in equal numbers, men develop pigmentary glaucoma up to 3 times more often than women. Myopia (nearsightedness) appears to be an important risk factor in the development of pigment-dispersion syndrome and is present in up to 80% of affected individuals.

The only clinical abnormalities are mild increase of the liver size (hepatomegaly) and chronic elevation of the transaminase levels in the blood without liver disease. Methionine may also be increased in urine. However, because elevated levels of methionine in the blood itself is a risk factor for development of neurological signs and symptoms, people with GNMT deficiency can have neurological problems when methionine levelsare greater than 800μmol/L.

The balanced translocation normally does not cause signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having a child with a chromosome abnormality like a deletion. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.To learn more about chromosome abnormalities in general, view our GARD fact sheet on Chromosome Disorders.",6.734771,-8.278003

This complex is important for the activation of the complement system (a group of proteins that work with the immune system). It also disposes cells that are dead. C1q deficiency presents in 2 different forms, absent C1q protein or abnormal C1q protein. Symptoms include infections (ear infections (otitis media), meningitis, urinary tract infections, oral infections); skin lesions (small blisters (vesicles), dark patches, and atrophic areas) that get worse upon light exposure; cataracts; loss of eyelashes, eyebrows, and scalp hair; blood in urine; and glomerulonephritis. About 93% of cases are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It can be caused by mutations in the C1QA, C1QB or C1QC genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

As many as 40% of individuals with cirrhosis and ascites will develop hepatorenal syndrome. Symptoms may include fatigue, abdominal pain, and a general feeling of ill health (malaise). There are two distinct types of hepatorenal syndrome. Type I progresses quickly (within days), leading to kidney failure. Individuals with type I typically have dramatically reduced urine output, edema, and jaundice, and often suffer from hepatic encephalopathy. Type II progresses more slowly, over weeks or months, and the symptoms are less severe. The cause of hepatorenal syndrome is unknown. A contributing factor seems to be a narrowing of the blood vessels that connect into the kidneys. This causes a decrease in blood flow to the kidneys, impairing their function. In some cases, triggers or precipitating factors (infections, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, low blood pressure) are involved. Treatment is aimed at helping the liver work better and maintaining kidney function. In many cases, a liver transplant is needed. In some cases, individuals also need a kidney transplant.",0.96612424,4.2948217

These severe pain periods can last from 20 minutes to days. The frequency of exacerbations also varies greatly. The headache stays on the same side of the head and usually without pain free periods. HC is more common in women and most often starts in adulthood, but may begin anywhere from 5 to 67 years of age. Diagnosis of hemicrania continua (HC) is made by ruling out other possible causes of the pain and by clinical symptoms. During the periods of severe pain, at least one of the following symptoms must be present on same side of the body as the headache: watering or red eyes (conjunctival injection), congested or runny nose, or drooping eyelid. In addition, the headache pain must respond to treatment with indomethacin. The cause of HC is unknown.

In hereditary amyloidosis, amyloid deposits most often occur in tissues of the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. While symptoms of hereditary amyloidosis may appear in childhood, most individuals do not experience symptoms until adulthood. There are many types of hereditary amyloidosis associated with different gene mutations and abnormal proteins. The most common type of hereditary amyloidosis is transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR),a condition in which the amyloid deposits are most often made up of the transthyretin protein which is made in the liver. Other examplesof hereditary amyloidosis include, but are not limited to, apolipoprotein AI amyloidosis (A ApoAI), gelsolin amyloidosis (A Gel), lysozyme amyloidosis (A Lys), cystatin C amyloidosis (A Cys), fibrinogen Aα-chain amyloidosis (A Fib), and apolipoprotein AII amyloidosis (A ApoAII).

NAIT was first reported in the literature in 1953 and is estimated to occur in as many as 1 in 1200 live births. NAIT results in the destruction of platelets in the fetus or infant due to a mismatch between the mother's platelets and those of the baby. Certain molecules (antigens) on the surface of the baby's platelets are recognized as foreign by the mother's immune system. The mother's immune system then creates antibodies that attack and destroy the baby's platelets. Though NAIT can occur whenever the mother's blood mixes with that of the baby, it is usually triggered when the mother is exposed to the baby's blood during delivery. Many cases of NAIT are mild. Signs and symptoms may include a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and signs of bleeding into the skin such as petechiae and purpura. In the most severe cases, NAIT can cause bleeding episodes that may result in death or long-term disability. Bleeding episodes can occur either during pregnancy or after birth.

It is a rare malformation, with only around hundred cases reported in the literature. When symptoms are present, they are caused by cerebrovascular insufficiency, compression of the brain by vessels that dilate to compensate for the absence of the ICA, or the presence of an aneurysm. Associated intracranial aneurysms occur in 25 to 35% of patients and are often responsible for intracranial hemorrhage, which may present as the initial symptom. The absence of the ICA is the result of either agenesis or aplasia. The term agenesis is used when both the ICA and its bony canal are absent, whereas there is some evidence of carotid canals in cases of aplasia. The absence of the ICA can be detected by angiography or by computerised tomography.",1.5556625,-5.614886

Symptoms include dull and persistent throat pain that may radiate to the ear and worsen with rotation of the head. Other symptoms may include difficulty swallowing, feeling that there is something stuck in the throat, tinnitus, and neck or facial pain. A second form of Eagle syndrome unrelated to tonsillectomy causes compression of the vessel that carries blood to the brain, neck, and face (carotid artery). This form can cause headache. Eagle syndrome is due to a calcified stylohyoid ligament or an elongated styloid process. The styloid process is a pointed part of the temporal bone that serves as an anchor point for several muscles associated with the tongue and larynx. The mainstay treatment for Eagle syndrome is surgery to shorten the styloid process (styloidectomy). Medical management may include the use of pain and anti-inflammatory medications, antidepressants, and/or steroids.

Whether these are distinct disorders rather than variants of one disorder is controversial, partly because the underlying cause of EFP is not known.Several treatments have been described with variable results, including various oral or topical medications and phototherapy.

FUMHD often begins as PLEVA, but then rapidly and suddenly progresses to large, destructive ulcers. There may be fever and extensive, painful loss of skin tissue as well as secondary infection of the ulcers. Diagnosis of FUMHD is confirmed by biopsy of skin lesions. FUMHD occurs more frequently in children, peaking at age 5 to 10. Males tend to be affected more often than females. While some cases of FUMHD have resolved without therapy, others have resulted in death. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment may help to reduce morbidity and death.",-0.67308235,-8.994488

FCE occurs when materials that are usually found within the vertebral disc of the spine enter into the nearby vascular system (veins and arteries) and block one of the spinal cord vessels. The signs and symptoms of FCE often develop after a minor or even unnoticed btriggering eventb such as lifting, straining, or falling. Symptoms of FCE may include neck and/or back pain, progressive muscle weakness, and paralysis.The exact underlying cause of FCE is poorly understood. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the disease. Diagnosis is based on imaging of the spinal cord and ruling out other causes of a blockage of the vascular system within the spinal cord.

One kind is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (also called ABPA), a condition where the fungus causes allergic respiratory symptoms similar to asthma, such as wheezing and coughing, but does not actually invade and destroy tissue. Another kind of aspergillosis is invasive aspergillosis. This infection usually affects people with weakened immune systems due to cancer, AIDS, leukemia, organ transplantation, chemotherapy, or other conditions or events that reduce the number of normal white blood cells. In this condition, the fungus invades and damages tissues in the body. Invasive aspergillosis most commonly affects the lungs, but can also cause infection in many other organs and can spread throughout the body (commonly affecting the kidneys and brain). Aspergilloma, a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of previous lung disease such as tuberculosis or lung abscess, is a third kind of aspergillosis.

Vision loss with both varieties is typically rapid (over minutes, hours, or days) and painless. Symptoms such as a general feeling of being unwell (malaise), muscle aches and pains, headaches over the temple, pain when combing hair, pain in the jaw after chewing, and tenderness over the temporal artery (one of the major arteries of the head) may be present with giant cell arteritis. At exam, visual acuity is reduced and the optic disc is swollen. In both subtypes, visual field examination is often reduced in the inferior and central visual fields. The visual loss is usually permanent, with some recovery possibly occurring within the first weeks or months. The arteritic variety is treated with corticosteroids.

It is caused by damage to the brain, especially the parietal lobe, and can arise from many diseases, tumors, a stroke, or traumatic brain injury. In some cases it is present from birth. There are several types of apraxia, which may occur alone or together. These include: Buccofacial or orofacial apraxia is the inability to carry out facial movements on demand. This may include licking the lips, sticking out the tongue, whistling, coughing, or winking. Ideational apraxia is the inability to carryout learned, complex tasks with multiple, sequential movements. This may include dressing, eating, and bathing. Ideomotor apraxia is the inability to perform a learned task (such as using a tool) or communicate using gestures (like waving good-bye). Limb-kinetic apraxia is the inability to make fine, precise movements with an arm or leg. This may include buttoning a shirt or tying a shoe. Verbal apraxia is difficulty coordinating mouth and speech movements. Verbal apraxia may be acquired or present from birth. Constructional apraxia is the inability to copy, draw, or construct simple figures. Oculomotor apraxia is difficulty moving the eyes on command. Treatment of apraxia may include physical, speech, or occupational therapy.

9194,"Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV) is a rare progressive disease that begins as a primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. In this type of infection, the body makes too many lymphocytes (lymphoproliferative disease) for a period of more than 6 months duration. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. They are an importantpart ofthe immune system because they help fight off diseases and protect the body from infection byproducing antibodies against viruses or bacteria and regulating immune responses. In CAEBV there are many antibodies againstEBV in the blood.Most people (about 95% of adults) get infected with EBV at some point in their lives, and never have any health problems.However, EBV can cause infectiousmononucleosis and other illnesses, and has a role in various autoimmune diseases and some types of cancer. While most infections occurring during childhood do not cause any symptoms,EBV infection in adolescents or young adults can often result in mononucleosis.After an EBV infection, the virus becomes latent (inactive) in the body, and, in some cases, the virus may reactivate. This does not always cause symptoms, but people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates.In rare cases, people infected with EBV develop chronic active EBV virus infection(CAEBV) without apparent immunodeficiency. Most cases of CAEBV have been reported from Japan. These patientshave some of the complications found in otherwise-healthy patients with acute EBV infection, but unlike healthy patients, these complications persist and progress. Symptoms of CAEBV most often include fever, liverdysfunction, an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), and low numbers of platelets (thrombocytopenia) as well as high EBV-DNA load in the blood. Other features that appear in more than 10% of patients include enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), anemia, hypersensitivity to mosquito bites, rash, oral ulcers, hemophagocytic syndrome, coronary artery aneurysms, liver failure, lymphoma, and interstitial pneumonia. While the cause is yet unknown, researchers have identified defects in T cells or natural killer (NK) cells activity which results in a decreased defense against the EBV in people with CAEBV.It is important to note that the fatigue and malaise from acute infectious mononucleosis (IM)varies from mild symptoms lasting only a few weeks, to more severe symptoms of fatigue that can persist for several months, or even up to a year or more in up to 10% of patients (which may be considered a less severe form of chronicEBV infection). The persistence of fatigue that is seen in some patients after acute IM would lead some people to believe that EBV may also cause cases of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). However, no convincing link has been found between EBV and CFS.Hematopoietic stemcell transplantation has shown promise in the treatment of CAEBV.",3.027907,2.51957

Some use the term 'Goodpasture syndrome' for the findings of glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage and the term 'Goodpasture disease' for those patients with glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and anti-GBM antibodies. Currently, the preferred term for both conditions is “ anti-GBM antibody disease ”. Circulating antibodies are directed against the collagen of the part of the kidney known as the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), resulting in acute or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Antibodies also attack the collagen of the air sacs of the lung (alveoli) resulting in bleeding of the lung (pulmonary hemorrhage). Symptoms may include general body discomfort or pain, bleeding from the nose and/or blood in the urine, respiratory problems, anemia, chest pain, and kidney failure. Anti-GBM disease is thought to result from an environmental insult (smoking, infections, exposure to certain drugs) in a person with genetic susceptibility, such as a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type. Diagnosis is confirmed with the presence of anti-GBM antibody in the blood or in the kidney.

9387,"Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder is which a person lacks the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, a protein needed to break down fat molecules. Deficiency of this enzyme prevents affected individuals from properly digesting certain fats. This results in the accumulation of fatty droplets called chylomicrons in the blood and an increase in the blood concentration of triglycerides. Symptoms include episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), abnormal enlargement of the liver and/or spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and the development of skin lesions known as erruptive xanthomas. Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by changes (mutations) in the LPL gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment aims to control symptoms and blood triglyceride levels with a very low-fat diet. Treatment for individual symptoms (i.e. pancreatitis) involves following established treatment guidelines.",3.9508586,3.4626615

The symptoms described in the few cases reported in the medical literature suggest that there may be variation in the severity of the symptoms ranging from severe early-onset cases, to milder late-onset presentations. In severe cases symptoms may include persistent and very low levels of blood's sugar in newborns (neonatal hypoglycemia), failure to thrive, build-up of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis), liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) and liver failure leading to neurological degeneration. Milder cases present during childhood with fewer and less serious liver problems. Infections and fasting may trigger the symptoms. PEPCK1 deficiency inheritance is autosomal recessive. It is caused by mutations in the PEPCK1 gene. Some researchers believe that the severity of the disease depend upon the mutations resulting in less or more PEPCK1 activity (the more active the enzyme is, the less severe the disease is, and vice versa). Treatment depend on the symptoms and may include giving extra carbohydrates during heavy exercise and illness or other times of fasting (formal sick day regimen) by the dietitian.PEPCK1 is the cytosolic form of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) enzyme, the other being the mitochondrial (PEPCK2).",5.016771,6.765917
